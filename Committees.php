The committee will also be in charge of the upcoming bar nights (read: parties). Think about coming up with themed bar nights and tapping those perfect beers for your fellow forcies.

								EA has tasks ranging from arranging exchanges with other associations to attracting new members during OWEE and IP. This is an awesome challenge which Force has taken on very well, looking at the increasing member count in the past years. This committee is for you if you are good at organising and want to help Force move forward!

							<div class="mainTextColor">
								Do you like over-engineering potentially useless stuff? Do you want to apply and learn more engineering skills in a not-so-serious environment? You’ve come to the right place. At happy engineering we’ll be working on crazy and vaguely useful contraptions that we may never end up finishing. It’s a good place to hone your electronics, programming, and mechanical design skills on projects such as a frisbee launching device, a beer pong timer, or an online chugging leaderboard. Oh and we have to make some wooden frisbee boxes too for “Disc on Campus”.

							<div class="mainContentSubHead">Sponsoring</div>

								Sport clubs need money to function, most of that is paid by our members, but extra money is even better. The best thing about sponsored money, is that it’s free money!! If you want to help raise money for Force, talk with companies, other organizations or know someone who’d be interested in sponsoring Force, this committee is amazing!

								Training is fun, but tournaments… that’s where the true experience begins: Winning against foreign teams, making new friends, hanging out next to the fields, watching others play and party into the early hours. In the Rising High committee, you get to create that experience! We build the stairs for winners to stand on, we choose the music people dance to and we create the memories of exciting, intense games. This committee has a lot of electrifying projects ahead: first and foremost to organise Rising High, our internationally known club tournament. Also smaller events need to be planned, supervised and advertised. So if you want to create memories, join and find out how and where you can let your talents shine!

							<div class="mainTextColor">
								Our sport is super fun, but everything can be a bit dangerous. Injuries are our main enemy, that is why the Injury Prevention Task Force (IPTF) is here for you! We collect data on current injuries after every season and store everyone's short summary on their journey on the way back to healthy and strong for more games! People that have acquired a recent injury can look into the database to contact people that have experienced similar injuries and might have advice. Also, the IPTF created an emergency sheet you can reference in case you find yourself in a situation where someone is (badly) injured and needs medical attention. The IPTF is here for you!
